# shfmt for Nova

A extension for Nova which integrates [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) for parsing, formatting and interpreting of shell
scripts in the [Nova](https://nova.app) text editor.

## Development

The extension is developed in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), which means it must be built before it
can be opened.

- `npm run build`: builds the extension
- `npm run test`: runs the tests
- `npm run lint`: runs all lints
- `npm run fix"`: fixes any fixable linter errors
- `npm run watch`: watches for changes, and rebuild the extension
